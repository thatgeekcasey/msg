// Brings a copy of Ember up to Ember's newest release. Deploy to Cloudflare copies Ember into a new
// repository without Ember's history, so the copy can't merge Ember's changes the usual way: this
// merges them itself, from the Ember commit the copy was made from, or the release its last update
// brought, so whatever the copy changed stays, such as the Worker's and bucket's names Deploy to
// Cloudflare wrote into wrangler.jsonc. The update is one commit on a branch named after the release,
// update-ember/v1.2.3, with conflict markers in any file where one of Ember's changes meets one of the
// copy's. A clone of Ember's repository shares its history, so it merges from where they part.
//
// The Update Ember workflow runs it every week with --publish, which pushes the branch and opens a
// pull request whose merge deploys the update (docs/self-hosting.md#updating). Without --publish, as
// for a copy on GitLab, run it in a clone of the copy, then push the branch it makes:
//
//   node apps/worker/scripts/update-ember.ts [--publish] [--beta]
//
// Ember's betas, such as v1.2.0-beta.1, which come before its releases, come only to a copy that asks
// for one, with --beta or the workflow's box for it, and to one that runs a beta already, which is
// brought the betas after it until a release passes it (docs/self-hosting.md#betas).
